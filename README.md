# SDnDTI Tutorial

**SDnDTI pipeline**. SDnDTI pipeline is demonstrated for a DTI acquisition consisting of three b = 0 image volumes and 18 diffusion-weighted image volumes. Instead of directly averaging multiple repetitions of acquired images, SDnDTI first denoises each single noisy image using a CNN with the averaged image as the higher-SNR training target, following normal supervised learning based denoising methods. Implementing SDnDTI for multiple interspersed b = 0 image volumes of a DTI dataset is straightforward. However, raw acquired data do not readily provide multiple repetitions of DWI volumes with identical image contrasts but independent noise observations. SDnDTI leverages the diffusion tensor model to transform the image contrast of DWIs. Specifically, SDnDTI divides all DWI volumes into several subsets (e.g., m subsets), each with six DWI volumes along diffusion-encoding directions optimized for the tensor fitting, then estimates diffusion tensors from each subset of DWI volumes (along with the averaged b = 0 image volume), and finally synthesizes DWI volumes along all acquired directions.

**Comprison of results**. DeepDTI results recover improved signal-to-noise ratio, image sharpness, and detailed anatomical information buried in the noise in the raw data and blurred out in the BM4D-noised results. Quantitative comparison can be found in the NeuroImage paper of DeepDTI.

**Comprison of tractography results**. DeepDTI denoised data recover more white matter fibers. Quantitative comparison of reconstructed fiber tracts and tract-specific analysis can be found in the NeuroImage paper of DeepDTI.
